I had a blast working remotely on this beast of an album with Canadian guitarist living in Japan, [Jordan Brock](https://www.theaxe.ca)!

Stylistically, it’s heavy, proggy, blackened post-hardcore with lyrics about dark fantasy and reality. Like if Protest the Hero got really into H.P. Lovecraft.

Most [instagram videos of me](https://www.instagram.com/p/C95ZU_Vh72M/) practicing [drum parts in 2024](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6rcmcQO4G0/) were for songs played on this album. Not every project lends itself to me going ham on drums, but this one did and I had a lot of fun with it!
