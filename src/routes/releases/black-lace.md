Vudu Revival wanted to capture their authentic live sound, so that’s exactly what we did! No click, no editing, no tuning, no doubled guitars, just three guys playing in a room and overdubbed vocals.

Sonically, these guys harken back to 80s rock in a big way, but with a bit of a modern twist. This song in particular channels Van Halen well.
