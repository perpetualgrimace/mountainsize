This track by WNC band Among the Forgotten might be the heaviest material I’ve worked on yet!

We built a tempo map in order to achieve the right feel from section to section in the song. Then for overdubs, we kept things simple and laid down a single pair of rhythm guitars, blending a real amp with amp sims to achieve a crushing guitar tone, with bass drops emphasizing each section. The utterly brutal vocal performance ties it all together.

After taking our time to get the right takes, this was a relatively easy mix!
