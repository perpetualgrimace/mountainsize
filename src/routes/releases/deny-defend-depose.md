The latest release by Sacramento CA artist Josh Brill (AKA Cloud Blood) is a brutal song with fittingly brutal cover art.

Oddly enough, I’ve been working with multiple artists on politically charged music this year. It’s almost like a lot of really bad things have been happening and making art about it is a productive and cathartic way of dealing with the feelings of helplessness.

Anyway, I would describe this one as darkwave meets progressive metal. It’s got melancholy electronic textures, huge 9 string guitar riffs, and a mathy breakdown — what’s not to love?
