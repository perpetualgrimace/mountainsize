This is the first project where I was brought on purely as a mixing engineer. The band tracked an album live at [Marshall Sound Studios](http://marshallsoundstudios.com/) with Amos McGregor and later did vocal overdubs. I was asked to deliver a mix that references legendary grunge recordings by STP and Nirvana, while keeping everything sounding natural.

Though the band ultimately decided to go in a totally different direction and restart the entire album recording process, they did enjoy how the song Pendulum turned out and added it to the massive [Caverns of Gold](https://cavernsofgold.bandcamp.com) compliation, raising money for WNC hurricane victims.
