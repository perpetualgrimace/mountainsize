My second release by Asheville NC pop punk band Drowning Leo! The band tracked live at the studio, and then we overdubbed guitars and vocals.

This song has a little something to say about those who view gun worship as the height of patriotism. Punk rock without protest is like icing without cake, so I’m glad to see this band deliver a serious message while staying sonically upbeat and fun.
