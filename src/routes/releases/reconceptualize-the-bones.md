In 2023, UK artist Rick Whitehead (AKA SparraLIMB) released From the Bones, an album that he worked on amid intense bouts of pain from arthritis. Having found himself increasingly unable to write new music due to his condition, Rick called upon friends he had made over the years in the indie music community, and this remix album was born!

Sonically, these remixes cover a lot of ground. You’ll find everything from metal to acoustic ballads to EDM. After submitting my own remix [Rendered Useless Remade](/releases/rendered-useless-remade), I was brought on to mix most of the heavier tracks, and I mastered the entire album.

Mastering an album with multiple genres and multiple indie artists was not an easy task, but multiple listeners have praised the album for both its production and cohesiveness!
