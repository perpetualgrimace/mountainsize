I had the pleasure of doing a stem master for this song by WNC rock band Counter. You could say the stem mastering process was like exploring the grey area between mixing and mastering.

I digress. This song feels like a bold step in a new, more modern direction for Counter, and I’m grateful to have been part of the process!
