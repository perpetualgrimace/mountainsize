Richmond VA band Asylum 213 wanted to capture their explosive live sound, so they recorded the song live with overdubs here at the studio. They nailed it, and this song wound up being really easy to mix as a result.

To my ears this song feels largely post-hardcore, juxtaposed with lush keytar synthscapes, a math rock surprise, and harsh vocals full of emotion. I’m honestly not sure who to compare this one to, they might have charted new territory!

As an aside, my grandma’s thoughts on this song are as follows: _“This started out really pretty and then someone started screaming.”_
