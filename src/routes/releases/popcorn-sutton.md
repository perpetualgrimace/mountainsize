Asheville NC band Michael Scott Groove is all over the map in terms of genre, but tasty grooves are a constant! The guys tried something a little different for Popcorn Sutton, with a bluegrass flavored intro featuring banjo, harmonica, stomps, and an epic vibraslap hit.

This was one of two songs recorded across two recording sessions. The band tracked live at the studio, and then we overdubbed guitars, vocals, and additional layers.
