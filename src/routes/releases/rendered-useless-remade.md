For the second time, I approached a remix by rewriting the song from the ground up. Also for the second time, the remix was chosen as a lead single for a remixÂ album. ðŸ¥°

Anyway, this single was a collaboration between TheÂ Welcoming and UK artist Rick Whitehead (AKA SparraLIMB) featuring Asheville NC artist AcklenÂ Walker.

If you've ever wondered how The Welcoming would sound if we had rap verses and tuned our guitars really low, hereâ€™s your chance to findÂ out!
