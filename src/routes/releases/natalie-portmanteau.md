Does tastefully melodic instrumental math rock sound like something you might enjoy? If so, say yes to _Say NO! To YES_!

This was a fun remote collaboration with Asheville guitarist extraordinaire Tim Duncan. He let me loose on drums and I wrote fittingly playful drum parts with lots of trashy cymbals to match.
