Neptune was an organic evolution from my solo project into a band. I like to think it’s more focused than [Decayed | Remade](./decayed-remade) despite the additional voices, since we had a better idea of where we wanted to take our sound.

We took our time crafting the songs and road tested a few of them. The mix is nice and balanced, with a bit less focus on rhythm guitars and more focus on vocals and bass.

I typically master my own music, but I put in so much time crafting this EP that I decided to bring in [Hugo GT](https://hugogt.ca/) as a mastering engineer, and I learned a lot from his approach and feedback.
