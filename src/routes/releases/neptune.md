Neptune was an organic evolution from my solo project into a band. I like to think it’s more focused than [Decayed | Remade](./decayed-remade) despite the additional voices, since we had a better idea of where we wanted to take our sound.

We took our time crafting the songs and road tested a few of them. The mix is nice and balanced, with a bit less focus on rhythm guitars and more focus on vocals and bass.

I really appreciated [Hugo GT’s](https://hugogt.ca/) approach and insights as a mastering engineer.

There’s also a [making of series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2OXkh0m_R5ykVrouKOwIC-gTso42KaLB) on YouTube.
