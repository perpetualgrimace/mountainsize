Asheville NC band Drowning Leo is a little bit pop punk, a little bit rock and roll. Sonically, this song is more the latter, though I would classify the lyrics as punk in their disdain and sharp sarcasm for people eager to believe anything but the truth.

Conspiracy is the first of two songs recorded across two recording sessions. The band tracked live at the studio, and then we overdubbed guitars and vocals.
