Asheville NC band Michael Scott Groove is all over the map in terms of genre. Unlike the southern charm of Popcorn Sutton, Inspired By You is sonically reminiscent of Rush.

This was one of two songs recorded across two recording sessions. The band tracked live at the studio, then later overdubbed guitars, vocals, and additional layers.
