In the fallout of hurricane Helene, Acklen Walker was compelled to work through what he was grappling with in the form of a song.

I’ve heard Acklen pull off everything from pop to hip hop, even performing enjoyable covers of songs that I typically can’t stand. The folk-driven sound on this song is new for both of us. Unsurprisingly, he nailed it!

Acklen wanted to keep the recording sounding natural, so I put up multiple mics on both his acoustic guitar and the room itself, and we tracked with the door to the studio left wide open. If you listen closely you can hear the sounds of sirens and local wildlife. When it was time to lay down drums, we opted instead to add layers of stomps, claps, and percussion.
