This single was a collaboration between The Welcoming and Olive Dares the Darkness where I approached remixing one of their songs by rewriting it from the ground up.

If you've ever wondered how The Welcoming would sound if we had a better lead singer and tuned our guitars really low, here’s your chance to find out!

This release mixed and mastered by Adam Whittaker at [Deluxe Mixing](https://www.deluxemixing.com).
