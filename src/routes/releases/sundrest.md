This Asylum 213 track was recorded during a late 2024 tracking session alongside [Prolonged Exposure to Delusion](/releases/petd), live with overdubs.

This recording is a reimagining of the closing track from Asylum 213’s 2021 album [Not Homeless / Just Hopeless](https://asylum213.bandcamp.com/album/not-homeless-just-hopeless). It reflects how the band has evolved the song in the intervening years.
