What I like about Asheville solo artist Wes Norris is that he embodies the idea of music as therapy. He's got a unique and emotive voice and he doesn't pull any punches when it comes to his lyrics.

I recorded and mixed a few songs by Wes in 2022 and 2023. Nihility was my favorite song of the bunch. It's got big dynamics, further emphasized by sudden tempo changes.
