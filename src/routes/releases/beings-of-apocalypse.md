A lot of the projects I get myself involved with are difficult to place into a genre box. But not this one! Embrace the Animal (formerly Last Left Standing) is metalcore through and through.

I joined the band after the material for this release had largely been written by Ken Mcafee, Nico Burnette, and James Holland; so I helped out where needed with the occasional riff, arrangement tweak, or lyric rewrite over the course of the recording process. You know, producer stuff!
